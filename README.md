For PokeAPI Assignment I have created HTML file including JS inside, and CSS for minor styling.
I started with creating an input box where users can type the name or ID of a Pokémon. 
Then I added a button 'onclick' to trigger the search when clicked.
After that I used a JS function to fetch and display Pokémon data asynchronously.
